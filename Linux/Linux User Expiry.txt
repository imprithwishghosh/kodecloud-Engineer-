A developer named john has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for john. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.


Therefore, create a user named john on the App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

  thor@jump_host ~$ ssh steve@172.16.238.11
 useradd john -e 2021-03-28
