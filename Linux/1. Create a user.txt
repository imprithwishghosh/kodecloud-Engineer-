For some security reasons xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted there rather than its default user. Since this is going to be the Apache user so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per requirements given below:


a. Create a user named ravi on the App server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

b. Set UID to 1240 and its home directory to /var/www/ravi


Solution : 

ssh into that server using ssh uname@ipadd
sudo useradd -u 1240 -d /var/www/ravi ravi
              |       |			  |
      userid(UID)     home directory     user

now checkc whether it has been set or not using cd/var/www/ then id uname
