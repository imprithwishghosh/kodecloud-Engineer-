The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool.


Create a user named kirsty in App Server 2 without a home directory.

solution ::
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
 sudo useradd -M yousuf
 sudo su
sudo passwd yousuf
 su - yousuf
su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/yousuf: No such file or directory
