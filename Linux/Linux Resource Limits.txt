On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:


a. soft limit = 1025

b. hard_limit = 2025



solution :
 vi /etc/security/limits.conf 
[root@ststor01 ~]#  cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
@nfsuser        soft    nproc           1025
@nfsuser        hard    nproc           2025
