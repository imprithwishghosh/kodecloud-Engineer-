We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself.


Using the playbook, install httpd web server on all app servers. Additionally, make sure its service should up and running.


Using blockinfile Ansible module add some content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.


The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.
