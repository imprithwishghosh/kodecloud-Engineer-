A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 1. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 1. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:


    Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory:
        Use any python image as the base image.
        Install the dependencies using requirements.txt file.
        Expose the port 6000.
        Run the server.py script using CMD.

    Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile.

    Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus:
        Map port 6000 of the container to the host port 8099.

    Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 1.

curl http://localhost:8099/

solution:

FROM python:3.9
COPY ./src /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5001
CMD ["python", "server.py"]

docker build -t nautilus/python-app .
docker run --name pythonapp_nautilus -d -p 8099:5001 b12e337555ca
