One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name games:devops. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

a. On App Server 1 save the image games:devops in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.



solution ::
 docker images
 docker save -o /tmp/games.tar games:devops


 scp /tmp/games.tar banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp
 ssh banner@172.16.238.12
 sudo su
 systemctl status docker
 docker load -i games.tar 
 docker images
