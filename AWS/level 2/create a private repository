The Nautilus DevOps team has been tasked with setting up a containerized application. They need to create a private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to store their Docker images. Once the repository is created, they will build a Docker image from a Dockerfile located on the aws-client host and push this image to the ECR repository. This process is essential for maintaining and deploying containerized applications in a streamlined manner.

Create a private ECR repository named devops-ecr. There is a Dockerfile under /root/pyapp directory on aws-client host, build a docker image using this Dockerfile and push the same to the newly created ECR repo, the image tag must be latest.
