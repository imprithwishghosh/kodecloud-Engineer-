The Nautilus DevOps team is currently working on setting up a simple application on the AWS cloud. They aim to establish an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of an EC2 instance where an Nginx server is currently running. While the Nginx server currently serves a sample page, the team plans to deploy the actual application later.

Set up an Application Load Balancer named datacenter-alb.
Create a target group named datacenter-tg.
Create a security group named datacenter-sg to open port 80 for the public.
Attach this security group to the ALB.
The ALB should route traffic on port 80 to port 80 of the datacenter-ec2 instance.
Make appropriate changes in the default security group attached to the EC2 instance if necessary
