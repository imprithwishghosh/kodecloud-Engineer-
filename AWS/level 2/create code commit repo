The Nautilus DevOps Team has received a request from the Development Team to set up a new repository for better code management. They need a secure way to access the repository using SSH.

Create a CodeCommit repository named devops-repo.
Add the root user's SSH public key from aws-client host to the 'SSH public keys for AWS CodeCommit' of the given IAM user.
Create an SSH config under /root/.ssh/config on aws-client host and make changes to authenticate with the created repository.
Clone the new repository on aws-client host under /root.
Add the contents of /root/pyapp directory to this repository, then add, commit, and push the changes to the repository. You might need to set the git user and email to commit your code, you can use any email ID and user name for that.
