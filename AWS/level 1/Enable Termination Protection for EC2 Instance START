As part of the migration, there were some components created under the AWS account. The Nautilus DevOps team created one EC2 instance where they forgot to enable the termination protection which is needed for this instance.

An instance named xfusion-ec2 already exists in us-east-1 region. Enable termination protection for the same.



solution : ec2 >> action >> instance settings >> change termination protection
