The Nautilus DevOps team is strategically planning the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Acknowledging the magnitude of this endeavor, they have chosen to tackle the migration incrementally rather than as a single, massive transition. Their approach involves creating Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) as the initial step, as they will be provisioning various services under different VPCs.

Create a VPC named devops-vpc in us-east-1 region with 192.168.0.0/24 IPv4 CIDR.
