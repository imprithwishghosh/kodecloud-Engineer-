The Nautilus DevOps team has recently deployed an RDS instance in the us-east-1 region. As this instance will be utilized for a production database, ensuring its security and protection is paramount. Upon inspection, it was discovered that delete/termination protection is not currently enabled for this instance. Consequently, the team aims to promptly enable this protection feature to prevent accidental deletion or termination of the instance.

RDS instance name is nautilus-rds, also make sure changes are effective immediately.
