The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

For this task, create an EC2 instance with following requirements:

1) The name of the instance must be nautilus-ec2.

2) You can use the Amazon Linux AMI to launch this instance.

3) The Instance type must be t2.micro.

4) Create a new RSA key pair named nautilus-kp.

5) Attach the default (available by default) security group.
