During the migration process, several resources were created under the AWS account. Later on, some of these resources became obsolete as alternative solutions were implemented. Similarly, there is an instance that needs to be deleted as it is no longer in use.
Recent security restrictions have revoked AWS console access. Nevertheless, the team retains CLI access via the aws-client host (the landing host for this lab), allowing them to manage AWS resources effectively.

1) Using AWS CLI, delete an ec2 instance named devops-ec2 present in us-east-1 region.

2) Before submitting your task, make sure instance is in terminated state.



solution ::


aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=devops-ec2" --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text
