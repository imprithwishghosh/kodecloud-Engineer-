The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro services on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and now they want set up some namespaces, deployments etc. Based on the current requirements, the team has shared some details as below:

Create a namespace named dev and create a POD under it; name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



solution ::

kubectl create namespace dev


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dev-nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: dev-nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: dev-nginx-pod
    image: nginx:latest

kubectl apply -f pod.yml -n=dev
