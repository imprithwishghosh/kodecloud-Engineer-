We encountered an issue with our Nginx and PHP-FPM setup on the Kubernetes cluster this morning, which halted its functionality. Investigate and rectify the issue:


The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Identify and fix the problem.

Once resolved, copy /home/thor/index.php file from the jump host to the nginx-container within the nginx document root. After this, you should be able to access the website using Website button on the top bar.



solution ::


kubectl get pod nginx-phpfpm -o > pod.yml


change moutpath to /usr/share/html to /var/www/html in 3 places

reapply the config file : kubectl replace --force -f pod.yml

kubectl cp /home/thor/index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html -c nginx-container
