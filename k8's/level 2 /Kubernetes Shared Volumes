We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.


    Create a pod named volume-share-xfusion.

    For the first container, use image fedora with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e fedora:latest, container should be named as volume-container-xfusion-1, and run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/news.

    For the second container, use image fedora with the latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e fedora:latest, container should be named as volume-container-xfusion-2, and again run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/cluster.

    Volume name should be volume-share of type emptyDir.

    After creating the pod, exec into the first container i.e volume-container-xfusion-1, and just for testing create a file news.txt with any content under the mounted path of first container i.e /tmp/news.

    The file news.txt should be present under the mounted path /tmp/cluster on the second container volume-container-xfusion-2 as well, since they are using a shared volume.

vi volume-share-xfusion.yml
kubectl apply -f volume-share-xfusion.yml 
 kubectl get pods

 cat volume-share-xfusion.yml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-share-xfusion
spec:
  containers:
  - name: volume-container-xfusion-1
    image: fedora:latest
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp/news
      name: volume-share
  - name: volume-container-xfusion-2
    image: fedora:latest
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp/cluster
      name: volume-share
  volumes:
  - name: volume-share
    emptyDir: {}

kubectl exec -it volume-share-xfusion -c volume-container-xfusion-1 -- bash
echo "This is a test file for volume sharing." > /tmp/news/news.txt

exit
thor@jumphost ~$ kubectl exec -it volume-share-xfusion -c volume-container-xfusion-2 -- bash
[root@volume-share-xfusion /]# ls

[root@volume-share-xfusion /]# cat /tmp/cluster/news.txt
This is a test file for volume sharing.
[root@volume-share-xfusion /]#
