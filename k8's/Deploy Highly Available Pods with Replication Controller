The Nautilus DevOps team is establishing a ReplicationController to deploy multiple pods for hosting applications that require a highly available infrastructure. Follow the specifications below to create the ReplicationController:

    Create a ReplicationController using the nginx image, preferably with latest tag, and name it nginx-replicationcontroller.

    Assign labels app as nginx_app, and type as front-end. Ensure the container is named nginx-container and set the replica count to 3.
