The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories /opt/games.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp directory. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.


Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games, further add/commit the file and push to the master branch.



solution : 

sudo scp /tmp/index.html  natasha@ststor01:/tmp

ssh natasha@ststor01

 sudo su -

cd   /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo/
 ls
 cp /tmp/index.html  .
 ls
index.html  info.txt  welcome.txt
 git add index.html 
 git commit -m "added index.html"
 git push origin master
