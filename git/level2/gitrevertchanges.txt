 The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).

Use revert games message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit. 



solution :
ssh into server
sudo su
cd / specified path

 git revert HEAD

 git status
 git add games.txt 
 git commit -m "revert games"
     git log

    Revert "add data.txt file"
    

    initial commit
