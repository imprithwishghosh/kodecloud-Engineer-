The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/blog.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:


Create a new branch nautilus in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.



solution ::
ssh into storage server
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/
git checkout -b nautilus master

sudo su
git branch
  
sudo cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog/
 git add index.html 
 git commit -m "added index.html"
 git checkout master
 git merge nautilus

git push origin master nautilus

git push -u origin nautilus
git push -u origin master

git status
