Create a Jenkins job named install-packages and configure it to accomplish below given tasks.

    Add a string parameter named PACKAGE.
    Configure it to install a package on the storage server in Stratos Datacenter provided to the $PACKAGE parameter.

Note:

1. You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also some times Jenkins UI gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end so in such case please make sure to refresh the UI page.

2. Make sure Jenkins job passes even on repetitive runs as validation may try to build the job multiple times.

3. For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

solution ::
ssh && parameter based job plugins should be innstalled
add storage server to credentials 
go to configure system add env  variable password 
create pipeline and echo "$PASSWORD" | sudo -S yum -y install $PACKAGE
